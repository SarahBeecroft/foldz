Example templates that you could use for different guides are available in this repository:

- [Standard page that can be used as a starting point for any type of guide.](example_page)
- [Suggested structure for a guide describing how to use a bioinformatics workflow](example_bioinformatics_workflow_page)
- [Suggested structure for documentation describing a workflow: based on Australian BioCommons documentation guidelines](example_workflow_documentation_page)

Use cases for different guides are described in the [How-to Guide for using this template](https://australianbiocommons.github.io/how-to-guide-template/how_to_guide_types).
